###  Regression Model: Salary Prediction

#### 1. Model Goals and Features

The goal of this regression model is to predict job salary based on structured features and analyze how different factors influence salary levels.  
The selected features include:
- Job title (`TITLE_RAW`)
- Industry (`NAICS`)
- Location (`STATE_NAME`)
- Number of skills required (`num_skills`)
- Whether the job is remote (`REMOTE_TYPE_NAME`)
- Whether the job is AI-related (`IS_AI_ROLE`)

#### 2. Model Conclusions and Insights

- AI-related jobs consistently offer higher salaries compared to non-AI roles.
- Remote positions and roles based in tech-centric states (e.g., California, Washington) are associated with higher salary ranges.
- The number of required skills correlates positively with salary, but the effect diminishes after a certain threshold (diminishing returns).

#### 3. Advice for Job Seekers

- Prioritize AI-related or hybrid roles that incorporate AI elements.
- Invest in developing in-demand skills such as machine learning, cloud computing (e.g., AWS).
- Consider targeting remote jobs or positions located in high-paying regions.

###  Classification Model: AI Role Detection

#### 1. Model Goals and Features

The goal of this classification model is to predict whether a job is AI-related based on categorical and numeric features.  
Key features include:
- Keywords in job title
- NAICS industry code
- Number of skills required
- Remote work indicator
- Location of job posting

#### 2. Model Conclusions and Insights

- Two classification models were built; the second model included additional engineered features.
- Overall accuracy improved to 69%, with recall for AI roles increasing from 0.39 to 0.45.
- The F1 score remains moderate (0.52), suggesting that class imbalance is still a challenge.

#### 3. Advice for Job Seekers

- Use AI-relevant keywords in job applications and resumes to align with AI classifications.
- Emphasize technical skills, especially machine learning and cloud technologies.
- Understand which job titles are commonly associated with AI to refine search strategies.

### Cross-Model Takeaways

- AI-related roles consistently signal higher compensation across models.
- Remote jobs are advantageous both in terms of flexibility and salary.
- Skill count is a strong predictor but shows a nonlinear relationship with salary.

### Limitations and Opportunities

- Class imbalance affected classification model performance.
- Future work could integrate NLP-based features (e.g., word embeddings, job description parsing).
- Modeling interaction effects and analyzing salary ranges (`SALARY_FROM` to `SALARY_TO`) could offer deeper insights.
