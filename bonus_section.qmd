## Bonus Section: NLP-Based AI Job Classification

This section was completed to fulfill the optional bonus (+10 points) for extended analysis using natural language processing.

We explored whether the textual content of job descriptions (`BODY`) could be used to predict whether a job is AI-related. This involved both classification modeling using TF-IDF features and visual inspection via WordClouds.

###  TF-IDF + Logistic Regression Classification

We used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert unstructured job description text into structured numerical features, selecting the top 1,000 tokens. A Logistic Regression classifier was trained to predict AI-related roles.

### WordCloud Analysis: AI vs. Non-AI Job Descriptions

To supplement the classification results, we generated WordClouds that visualize the most frequently appearing words in AI and non-AI job descriptions.

#### Non-AI Job WordCloud

**Insights from WordClouds:**
- AI job descriptions prominently include terms like `"data analyst"`, `"data governance"`, `"experience with data"`, and `"machine learning"`.
- Non-AI jobs also emphasize `"ability to"`, `"collaborate"`, and `"communication"`, but with less technical specificity.
- Both categories include standard HR language, such as `"equal opportunity"`, `"bachelor degree"`, and `"job description"`.

These patterns reinforce the idea that AI roles emphasize technical proficiency, while non-AI roles lean toward soft skills and operational language.

### âœ… Takeaways

- Job description text alone can provide predictive signals for AI-related role detection.
- NLP-based classification adds interpretability and complements structured-data models.
- Job seekers targeting AI careers should consider using technical terms in resumes that align with frequently appearing phrases in AI postings.

This bonus section demonstrates the value of unstructured data in employment analytics and enriches our broader findings on AI job trends.
