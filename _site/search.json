Additionally, NAICS2 - NAICS6 include excessive industry classification codes that may cause redundancy, while SOC_2, SOC_3, and SOC_5 are detailed occupational classifications that do not impact the final analysis. As multiple versions of NAICS/SOC codes, it is important to remove several of them. Since different versions provide similar information but may include duplicates or slight variations, leading to data bloat. Besides, if we do not cancel them, it is possible that we use two different version to analysis. This may cause problem in deeper analysis. In order to improve the accuracy of analysis, we first deleted irrelevant columns to reduce irrelevant data and improve the efficiency of data cleaning. Then remove duplicate data to ensure that each recruitment information is unique to prevent data duplication.

This chart can show the median and extreme values ​​of salaries in different industries. The pie chart shows the proportion of remote or offline work. The line chart can show the trend more clearly and is used to observe whether AI-related positions are actually growing faster.\n\ntop_20_industries = df[\"NAICS2_NAME\"].value_counts().nlargest(20)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\ntop_20_industries.plot(kind=\"bar\", color=\"steelblue\")\nplt.title(\"Job Postings by Industry\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Job Postings\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha=\"right\")\nplt.grid(axis=\"y\", linestyle=\"--\", alpha=0.7)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Chart: Job Postings by Industry Key Findings 1.- The chart shows that “Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services” has a much higher number of job postings than any other industry, more than double the number of the second industry. This indicates that specialized skills such as technology, engineering, data science, and consulting are in high demand. 2. Higher demand for hiring in Finance and Insurance and Manufacturing indicates a growth in demand for skilled professionals in these sectors. 3. Retail, Arts, Accommodation and Food Services have significantly lower hiring demand, reflecting the fact that these industries may be affected by automation, the economic climate and the development of AI. 4. Higher hiring in Unclassified Industries, which may include emerging industries or cross-cutting positions such as AI R&D and freelancing, suggests that the labor market is undergoing structural change. Key insights Job seekers can focus more on high-demand industries, especially in technology, finance and manufacturing. AI and data-related careers are in high demand, and upgrading skills such as Python, SQL, and machine learning will increase competitiveness. Candidates in low-demand sectors can transition into cross-industry roles, such as tech-related roles or upgrading cross-industry skills.\n\ntop_20_industries = df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].value_counts().nlargest(20)\ndf_filtered = df[df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].isin(top_20_industries.index)]\n\nsalary_columns = [\"Salary\", \"WAGE\", \"COMPENSATION\", \"HOURLY_RATE\"]\nsalary_col = next((col for col in df.columns if col in salary_columns), None)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(data=df_filtered, x=\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\", y=salary_col)\n\nplt.title(\"Salary Distribution by Industry\", fontsize=14)\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha=\"right\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Salary\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot: Salary Distribution by Industry Key Findings 1. The box plot shows a wide distribution of median salaries by industry, which suggests that there may be large salary gaps between industries. 2. Certain industries have narrower salary distributions, such as General Medical and Surgical Hospitals and Insurance Agencies and Brokerages, suggesting that salaries in these industries are relatively stable and may have standardized salary structures. 3. The impact of outliers touching the far ends of the box plot suggests that extreme high salaries in certain industries (e.g., executive positions, hot tech jobs) can significantly drive up average salaries. Key insights For job seekers looking for higher salaries, focus on industries with wider salary distributions and higher upper quartiles. For job seekers looking for a stable salary, healthcare and education industries offer less salary variability and are ideal for long-term career planning. Industry choice is critical to salary growth, and job seekers can choose a career path that suits them based on salary distribution and their own skills.\n\ndf[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"] = df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"].replace({None: \"On-Site\", \"[None]\": \"On-Site\"})\n\nremote_counts = df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"].value_counts()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.pie(remote_counts, labels=remote_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=['#636EFA', '#EF553B', '#00CC96', '#AB63FA'])\n\nplt.title(\"Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\", fontsize=14)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPie Chart: Remote vs. On-Site Jobs Key Findings 1. 78.3% of jobs are on-site, indicating that despite the growth of remote jobs, most companies still prefer employees to work in the office. 2. Remote jobs make up 17% of the workforce, indicating that the trend toward telecommuting continues to grow. 3. The growth of the Hybrid Remote model, with 3.11% of positions being Hybrid Remote, suggests that some companies are adopting a part remote, part on-site work model to increase employee flexibility and productivity. 4. Not Remote may mean that some positions are explicitly not telecommuting. key insights Hybrid office models are growing, and job seekers can choose flexible work arrangements, such as looking for partially remote positions, to improve life-work balance. On-site work is still the mainstream, and job seekers need to consider industry characteristics and their own needs.\n\nprint(\"Data Cleaning and EDA completed successfully\")\ndf.head()\n\nData Cleaning and EDA completed successfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST_UPDATED_DATE\nPOSTED\nEXPIRED\nDURATION\nSOURCE_TYPES\nSOURCES\nTITLE_RAW\nBODY\nMODELED_EXPIRED\nMODELED_DURATION\n...\nSOC_3_NAME\nSOC_4\nSOC_4_NAME\nSOC_5_NAME\nNAICS_2022_2_NAME\nNAICS_2022_3_NAME\nNAICS_2022_4_NAME\nNAICS_2022_5_NAME\nNAICS_2022_6\nNAICS_2022_6_NAME\n\n\n\n\n0\n2024-09-06\n2024-06-02\n2024-06-08\n6.0\n[\\n \"Company\"\\n]\n[\\n \"brassring.com\"\\n]\nEnterprise Analyst (II-III)\n31-May-2024\\n\\nEnterprise Analyst (II-III)\\n\\n...\n2024-06-08\n6.0\n...\nMathematical Science Occupations\n15-2050\nData Scientists\nData Scientists\nRetail Trade\nMotor Vehicle and Parts Dealers\nAutomotive Parts, Accessories, and Tire Retailers\nAutomotive Parts and Accessories Retailers\n441330\nAutomotive Parts and Accessories Retailers\n\n\n1\n2024-08-02\n2024-06-02\n2024-08-01\n18.0\n[\\n \"Job Board\"\\n]\n[\\n \"maine.gov\"\\n]\nOracle Consultant - Reports (3592)\nOracle Consultant - Reports (3592)\\n\\nat SMX i...\n2024-08-01\n16.0\n...\nMathematical Science Occupations\n15-2050\nData Scientists\nData Scientists\nAdministrative and Support and Waste Managemen...\nAdministrative and Support Services\nEmployment Services\nTemporary Help Services\n561320\nTemporary Help Services\n\n\n2\n2024-09-06\n2024-06-02\n2024-07-07\n35.0\n[\\n \"Job Board\"\\n]\n[\\n \"dejobs.org\"\\n]\nData Analyst\nTaking care of people is at the heart of every...\n2024-06-10\n8.0\n...\nMathematical Science Occupations\n15-2050\nData Scientists\nData Scientists\nFinance and Insurance\nInsurance Carriers and Related Activities\nAgencies, Brokerages, and Other Insurance Rela...\nOther Insurance Related Activities\n524291\nClaims Adjusting\n\n\n3\n2024-09-06\n2024-06-02\n2024-07-20\n48.0\n[\\n \"Job Board\"\\n]\n[\\n \"disabledperson.com\",\\n \"dejobs.org\"\\n]\nSr. Lead Data Mgmt.

    "text": "AI is completely disrupting various industries, and it makes us all wondering about what this will mean for jobs. Although some sectors are gaining more jobs due to AI automation, others are trimming staff. In the middle of all this, job seekers definitely need to get a grip on which jobs are emerging in the AI era and what they need to be training for.\nTherefore, to begin with, we need to look at the trends in the job market for AI jobs and normal jobs. This research is all about determining whether AI is indeed creating more jobs or simply eliminating the traditional ones, as well as which sectors are being boosted by it, and what qualifications are required for AI jobs versus the normal ones. AI will probably create new career paths while reconfiguring existing ones (Soueidan and Shoghari (2024)).By examining employment trends, pay comparisons, and skill demand, we want to offer some advice on how people can prepare for the evolving workforce."
